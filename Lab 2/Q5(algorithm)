Q1. Implement an algorithm for determining if an Nth is a divisor of an n Number (i.e. 2 is a divisor of 6).
If so, determine if itâ€™s an even number or odd number as well.

1. Ask the user to enter Nth
2. Ask the user to enter n
3. IF n modulo Nth is equal to 0 (n % Nth == 0)then
4. Display Nth is the divisor of n
5. Else Display the Nth is not the divisor of n
6. To check if Nth is even or odd
7. IF Nth modulo 2 is equal to 0 (Nth % 2 == 0)
8. Display the Nth is even 
9. Else Display the Nth is odd
