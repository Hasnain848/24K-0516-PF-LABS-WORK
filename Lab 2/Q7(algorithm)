Q3. Implement an algorithm for making a simple calculator with all the operators (+,-,*,/,%)
1. Ask the user to enter the Number1
2. store the Number1
3. Ask the user to enter the operator(+,-,*,/,%).
4. Read the operator.
5. Ask the user to enter the Number2
6. Store the Number 2
7. If the operator is equal to + (operator == +) then
8. calcultate the result= Number1 +Number2
9. Display the result
10.Else IF the operator is equal to - (operator == -) then
11.calculate the result= Number1 - Number2
12.Display the result
13.Else If the operator is equal to * (operator== *) then
14.calculate the result = Number1 * Number2
15.Display the result
16.Else If the operator is equal to / (operator== /) and Number2 is not equal to 0(Number2 != 0)then 
17.calculate the result = Number1 / Number2
18.Display the result
19.Else Display error
20.End if
21.Else if the operator is equal to % (operator== %) and Number2 is not equal to 0(Number2 != 0)then 
22.calculate the result = Number1 % Number2
23.Display the result
24.Else Display error
25.END
