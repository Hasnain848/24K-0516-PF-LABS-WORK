Q1. Implement an algorithm for determining if an Nth is a divisor of an n Number (i.e. 2 is a divisor of 6).
If so, determine if itâ€™s an even number or odd number as well.

1. Ask the user to enter Nth
2. Ask the user to enter n
3. IF n modulo Nth is equal to 0 (n % Nth == 0)then
4. Display Nth is the divisor of n
5. Else Display the Nth is not the divisor of n
6. To check if Nth is even or odd
7. IF Nth modulo 2 is equal to 0 (Nth % 2 == 0)
8. Display the Nth is even 
9. Else Display the Nth is odd
 
Q.2 Implement an algorithm where the user enters a number, and an appropriate month is displayed.

1. Ask the user to enter the number between 1 to 12
2. Ensure the entered number is with in the range of 1 to 12.
4. if the number is not in a valid range then inform the user to enter the valid number 
3. Define a list where the index corresponds to the month number. For example, index 0 corresponds to January, index 1 to February, and so on.
4. Use the list to find the month corresponding to the entered number. Since list indices start from 0, subtract 1 from the entered number to get the correct index.
5. Print the month that correspond the number

Q3. Implement an algorithm for making a simple calculator with all the operators (+,-,*,/,%)
1. Ask the user to enter the Number1
2. store the Number1
3. Ask the user to enter the operator(+,-,*,/,%).
4. Read the operator.
5. Ask the user to enter the Number2
6. Store the Number 2
7. If the operator is equal to + (operator == +) then
8. calcultate the result= Number1 +Number2
9. Display the result
10.Else IF the operator is equal to - (operator == -) then
11.calculate the result= Number1 - Number2
12.Display the result
13.Else If the operator is equal to * (operator== *) then
14.calculate the result = Number1 * Number2
15.Display the result
16.Else If the operator is equal to / (operator== /) and Number2 is not equal to 0(Number2 != 0)then 
17.calculate the result = Number1 / Number2
18.Display the result
19.Else Display error
20.End if
21.Else if the operator is equal to % (operator== %) and Number2 is not equal to 0(Number2 != 0)then 
22.calculate the result = Number1 % Number2
23.Display the result
24.Else Display error
25.END
